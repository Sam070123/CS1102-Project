		<h2>Importance of HTTPS</h2><br/><br/>
	<p>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is essential for secure communication on the Internet, and the following are just a few of the important features that make it possible for today's web to grow rapidly and healthily.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th colspan="2">Features </th>
				<th>Explanation</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="2"><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/HTTPS" target="_blank">Encryption</a></td>
				<td>HTTPS encrypts data exchanged between a user's browser and a Web site using Transport Layer Security encryption.<br/> With HTTPS, traffic is encrypted so that even if packets are sniffed or otherwise intercepted, they appear as meaningless characters. <br/>This makes it difficult for hackers to intercept and understand the information being transmitted.<br/> This is important on networks where users drop a lot of personal data, especially to protect sensitive data such as login credentials, personal information and payment details.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="2">Data integrity</td>
				<td>It is very effective in preserving the data in transit and ensures that the data sent and received cannot be tampered with during transmission.<br/> Without HTTPS, third parties may alter the information exchanged between users and websites, which may result in error messages or malicious content injection.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="2"> Trust and Credibility</td>
				<td>HTTPS has developed a solid authority, and sites that use HTTPS are generally viewed as more trustworthy by users.<br/> Browsers mark HTTPS sites as secure and display a padlock icon in the URL bar.<br/> This increases user confidence in your site, which is especially important for e-commerce and sites that handle sensitive information, and makes it easier for users to recognize suspicious sites.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="2">SEO Advantage</td>
				<td>Traditional and popular browsers such as Google, Firefox and Internet Explorer favor HTTPS sites,<br/> which means that switching to HTTPS can help improve your site's visibility and search engine rankings, as well as increase your resources.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="2"><a href="https://https.cio.gov/guide/" target="_blank">Compliance</a></td>
				<td>For certain types of websites, especially those that handle sensitive user data, the use of HTTPS is required by various legal and regulatory standards such as the GDPR, PCI DSS and HIPAA.<br/> Compliance with these standards is critical to avoiding legal issues and fines, and is key to ensuring that some browsers are able to pass policies that make them widely available to the general public.
</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table><br/><br/><br/>

	<p>From the above properties, we can see that HTTPS is particularly important for users, browsers, network development, and even business development, especially in this era of rapid development of e-commerce, network security is essential.</p>
