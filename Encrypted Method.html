  <h2>4.Encrypt method</h2>
  <p>HTTPS uses a Transport Layer Security (TLS)/ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt messages between a client and server.
  	<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/HTTPS" target="	_blank">(Awati, 2022)</a> 
  	There are two primary types of Encryption which are symmetric encryptions and asymmetric encryptions. Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both the encryption and decryption of a message, while asymmetric encryption applies a public key and a private key to perform the encryption and decryption.

  	Both encryption methods have advantages and disadvantages as mentioned below:

  <p>We can mix the two methods and use them together to become a hybrid cryptosystem which mixes the convenience of an asymmetric encryption scheme with the effectiveness of a symmetric encryption scheme

  	And the examples below are constantly improving for various reasons. For example, AES was developed to address the vulnerability of its predecessor, DES, which had a short encryption key length susceptible to brute force attacks.

  	Finally, we may conclude that data security has improved
