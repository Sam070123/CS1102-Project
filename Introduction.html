	<h1> Introduction of HTTP and HTTPS </h1>

	<h2> HTTP </h2>


<p>HTTP, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, defines a set of rules that govern the transfer of different types of files, such as text, images, audio, video, and multimedia content over the internet. When users open their web browsers, they are indirectly utilizing HTTP to access and retrieve web resources. HTTP is an application protocol that relies on the TCP/IP suite of protocols, which forms the fundamental infrastructure of the internet (Chai & Ferguson, 2021). </p>
<P>It is a protocol used in client-server architectures, boosting communication between a client and a server over a network. The client (device) initiates the interaction by sending a request to the server. Upon receiving the request, the server processes it and generates a response. This response is then transmitted back to the client via the network(Vasav, 2024). </P>
<p>In the HTTP request and response cycle, a user types in a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to the HTTP client, then the client builds a request, specifying the information wanted to be generated by a server. Once receiving the request, the server uses the provided information to construct a response. Once the response is prepared, it will transmit back to the client in the requested format, ready to be rendered and presented to the user.</p>

<h2> HTTPS </h2>

<br / >
<p>HTTPS, stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is an add-on of the HTTP protocol with security features, the function is to encrypt and authenticate mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality and integrity, and authenticity of data transmitted between client and server (Awati, 2022). 
</a>
<p>TLS serves as the fundamental protocol that makes secure communication possible within the context of HTTPS. When a client starts a connection with a website using HTTPS, the TLS protocol comes into work to establish a secure and encrypted connection between two parties. This establishment of a secure connection is accomplished through a process known as the TLS handshake, which encompasses key exchange, verification of the server's digital certificate, and negotiation of encryption algorithms and parameters. When a client establishes a connection with a website that implements HTTPS, the server's identity is verified by TLS, and the connection is encrypted. This encryption ensures that any data transmitted between the client's device and the website cannot be intercepted by hackers(Bone, 2023).</p>
